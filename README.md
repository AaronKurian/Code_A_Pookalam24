# Pookalam Design using Python Turtle

This project was created as part of the **Code a Pookalam Contest** organized by **FOSS MEC** and **TINKERHUB MEC**. It is a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a colorful Pookalam design, a traditional floral pattern associated with the Onam festival.

## Introduction

The Pookalam is a key part of the Onam celebrations in Kerala. This project uses Python's Turtle graphics to create a virtual Pookalam with various geometric shapes, colors, and patterns. The design can be customized in terms of colors, shapes, and layout, allowing for creative freedom in replicating traditional Pookalams or experimenting with new designs.

## Video Demonstration

Here is a short video showing the execution of the Pookalam design:

## Features

- A colorful floral design with multiple concentric layers and patterns.
- Customizable color schemes and shapes for each layer.
- Text rendering using Turtle's built-in font capabilities.
- Smooth, fast drawing with Turtle's `speed(0)` function.
- Designed to display "Happy Onam" using **Courier Bold Italic** font.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To get started, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaronKurian/Code_A_Pookalam24.git
cd Code_A_Pookalam24
```
### Install Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download it from Python.org.

Then, install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: If the requirements.txt file lists the turtle module, you may skip installing it since it comes with Python by default.

## How to Run
After installation, you can run the program by executing the following command:

```bash
python pookalam.py
```
### Note:
To view the entire content on the Turtle graphics screen, please **maximize** the window to full screen. This ensures that all patterns and designs are fully visible.

A Turtle graphics window will open, and the Pookalam design will be drawn automatically. You can click on the Turtle window to close it once the drawing is complete.

## Customization
- Colors: Modify the color scheme by changing the color values in the Turtle function calls.
-  Shapes: You can modify the patterns by adjusting the size, shape, and number of circles or triangles.
-  Text: The "Happy Onam" message can be customized in terms of font size, style, and position.
-  Execution Speed: You can adjust the drawing speed by modifying the speed() function.
